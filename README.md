RoboCOP interface

The name came from the comment of the user Fernando 2RUGE294 in conversation with Celo 2RUGE295 saying that this interface was just missing to talk... But it talks!! looks like a RoboCOP!!! And so it was named

This project is a controller interface for a VOIP gateway for GMRS or RUGE radios as they are called in Brazil.

Through several gateways installed in distant cities and connected to the same Zello channel, this system allows radio communication between users from all locations in the coverage area of the gateways' radios, in addition to communicating with smartphones in any location with access to Internet.

It is responsible for controlling the radio's PTT and the Zello's PTT, enabling communication.

It was based on changing the color of the PTT button on the Zello and the rx/tx LED on the HT, which are monitored through LDRs pasted on the smartphone screen on the edge of the Zello button and on the rx/tx LED on the HT. According to the readings obtained, the controller triggers the necessary PTT. This interface also transmits gateway status information, time message and periodic messages.

I am a hobbyist and a beginner in electronics and programming, for this reason the most experienced ones will certainly find many errors and points that can be improved both in hardware and software. I appreciate any corrections or suggestions that could improve the functioning of the system!!
